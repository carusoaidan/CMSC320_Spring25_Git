Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: git is the most widely used version control systems which enables tracking of changes to files and 
easier collaboration among multiple people. It can be accessed via a command line. A repo contains all project files
and thier complete revision history whic is stored in a .git subfolder. it also supports branching and merging
allowing concurrent workflows and providing robust tools for handling conflicts.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: one field that data science can be applied to is Finance. One example would be using historical data to 
optimize investment portfolios and make the most money possible from using data as an inference.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines branches into one, rebasing moves commits from one branch to another. Merging preserves 
history as it happened, rebasing rewrites history to create a linear history. Merging creates a new merge commit,
rebasing does not.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester

Answer: I am looking forward to expanding my computer science knowledge using and applying all my classes to the best
of my abilities and expanding my knowledge when it comes to data science.
