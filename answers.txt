Answer: git is the most widely used version control systems which enables tracking of changes to files and 
easier collaboration among multiple people. It can be accessed via a command line. A repo contains all project files
and thier complete revision history whic is stored in a .git subfolder. it also supports branching and merging
allowing concurrent workflows and providing robust tools for handling conflicts.
